Generic Rockband MIDI Driver
This project continues to evolve. The original readmes are below. I have always found it simplest to build with the terminal command:

 gcc main.c -o rbdrum2midi -lasound -lusb-1.0

then running the output program using

./rbdrum2midi

For addition information on useage, run it with the -h option.

Rockband 3 ProDrum Midi Driver
by Randommatt

Version 0.1

This userland program uses libusb to gain access to the velocity sensitive 
data in the rockband 3 wireless usb prodrum controller (with cymbals) and use it as an ALSA 
MIDI controller. It has a low latency setup so that it can give a fairly 
good drumming experience. This is an evolution of the Rockband 2 Drum Driver of which I have 
attached the original README.

Installation:
Requires libusb and libasound2 dev packages to compile and runtime libraries to run
It follows the ussual cmmi:
./configure
make 
make install

Execution:
either run the executable localy: 
src/rbdrum2midi (you may have to run this as root if you do not have the correct usb permissions)
or run from terminal:
rbdrum2midi

Usage:
connect rbdrumkit wireless dongle (PS3 works, Wii should, xbox probably won't), 
start rbdrum2midi. This will create an ALSA midiport, start the jack audio server and Hydrogen,
in the connection window under the alsa tab connect "129:PS3 Joystick Client" to Hydrogen.
the midi channels are mapped as follows

kick pedal 1: 	midi note 36
kick pedal 2: 	midi note 42
red pad : 	midi note 37
yellow pad:	midi note 38
yellow Cymbal:	midi note 41
blue pad:	midi note 39
blue Cymbal:	midi note 43
green pad:	midi note 40
green Cymbal:	midi note 45

This corresponds to the setup for the Hydrogen YamahaVintageKit.

To fix usb permission problems create the file 90-PS3-drumkit.rules with the following line:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="12ba", ATTR{idProduct}=="0210", GROUP="audio", MODE="0664"

place this file in /etc/udev/rules.d/

and reload the udev deamon.

The original programs' copyrights, disclaimers and limitations still hold.
